Building

Building the GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GUI can be built in both a development and production form. In development,
the files are not minified. In production, the files are minified with
uglifyJS.

To build the GUI mode, run:

::

    make gui

You can clear away the built files by running:

::

   make clean-gui

Running the GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run the GUI with the makefile:

::

   make run

This will spin up a python development server listening on `0.0.0.0:6543`.
Changes to relevant files will cause the server to automatically reload them.

You can also run the server without the watcher using

::

   make server

To run the server with production settings use

::

   make qa-server

Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The test suite can be run using

::

   make test

Testing the GUI via the charm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most realistic way to test the GUI is to deploy the Juju GUI charm after
including any changes you've made to the GUI.

Assuming ``$GUI`` is your GUI repo and ``$CHARM`` is your charm repo, do the following:

1. Move to the GUI directory and build the distribution that you want to
   exercise: 

::
   
   cd $GUI && make dist
   
The above creates a bz2 archive with the GUI release in ``$GUI/dist/``.

2. Remove the release stored in the charm and copy the dist archive to the
   releases directory of the charm:

::
   
   rm $CHARM/releases/*.bz2
   cp $GUI/dist/*.bz2 $CHARM/releases/

3. Bootstrap the environment and deploy the charm:

::

   juju switch <your preferred provider>
   juju bootstrap
   cd $CHARM && make deploy

4. Optionally enable debug mode in the GUI service so that the unit serves the unminified static files:

::

   juju set juju-gui juju-gui-debug=true
   
At this point it is possible to manually hack on the unit files: the GUI lives
at ``/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/jujugui/static/gui/build/app/``

When the above is already set up, you have some local changes and you want to
test them live, you can quickly just upload and install the new resulting
release, like the following:

1. Create a new release (same as point 1 above):

::

   cd $GUI && make dist

2. Upload the resulting archive (this assumes the unit is juju-gui/0):

::

   juju ssh juju-gui/0 mkdir /tmp/release
   juju scp $GUI/dist/*.bz2 juju-gui/0:/tmp/release

3. Install the new release in the GUI unit:

::

   juju ssh juju-gui/0 "sudo pip install --no-index --no-dependencies -U /tmp/release/*.bz2‚Äù
