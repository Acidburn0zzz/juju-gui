# This file keeps track of the changes to the project.  We use it both to
# document the changes, and to find the most recent version numbers.  See the
# release process documented in docs/process.rst for details.

# This file uses the YAML format because it is easy to write and it is easy to
# convert to JSON, which seemed like a reasonable goal in case we want to use
# this data in the GUI itself at some point.  Here's an example of how to
# write the changes data.

#     Another thing that spans multiple lines
#     like this
# - 0.4.0:

#   - Ooh!

# Release identifiers in this file should always be "unreleased" or
# [NUMBER].[NUMBER].[NUMBER] per http://semver.org/ .
