Style Guide
===========

This guide is an attempt to describe a code style that both works well with the
JavaScript beautifier and helps developers avoid pitfalls.


For loops
=========

Unless you are counting something, for loops (and for-in loops) are a trap.
Use Y.Object.each instead.


Whitespace
==========

No trailing whitespace on lines or at the end of the file (i.e., the file
should end with a non-blank line).


Object literal formatting
=========================

Things you should do:

- object literals have their opening brace on a new line and the first
  value (if any) is on the same line (i.e., the opening brace is not on
  a line by itself)
- there is a space after the opening brace of an object literal
- object literals have their closing brace on the same line as their
  last value (i.e., the closing brace is not on a line by itself)

Things the beautifier should do (given an input line with no indentation at
all):

- all of the keys of an object literal line up (the second and
  subsequent key names are indented 2 spaces more than the indentation
  of the opening brace of the object literal
- lines after a line that ends in an equals sign are indented 4 (more)
  spaces
- lines after a line that ends in a colon are indented 6 (more) spaces
