Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect\nof your system using a cross-platform specification language that\nmanages all the separate elements normally aggregated in different\nfiles, like users, cron jobs, and hosts, along with obviously discrete\nelements like packages, services, and files.  Puppet's simple\ndeclarative specification language provides powerful classing\nabilities for drawing out the similarities between hosts while\nallowing them to be as specific as necessary, and it handles\ndependency and prerequisite relationships between objects clearly and\nexplicitly.\n",
