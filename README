Juju-GUI
========

Welcome. Juju-GUI is a web-based GUI for `Juju <https://juju.ubuntu.com/>`_.
Juju lets you deploy connected services to the cloud in a convenient,
vendor-neutral, and powerful way. The GUI lets you visualize and manage
your work more intuitively from a web browser.

Juju-GUI releases and the current code are `on Launchpad
<https://launchpad.net/juju-gui>`_.

- a `demo of trunk <http://uistage.jujucharms.com:8080/>`_, which is reset
  every 15 minutes.

Deploy
======

The most useful available commands are shown by the ``make help`` command.
You'll typically want to run one of ``make prod``,  ``make debug`` or ``make
devel`` to deploy an environment. You might also run ``make test-debug`` and
``make test-prod`` to check that everything is ok, and ``make docs`` to
generate the available documentation for both project and code.

Automatic deploy
----------------

You may also deploy the GUI in an automated fashion by means of the `Juju GUI
charm <http://jujucharms.com/~juju-gui/precise/juju-gui>`_.

Configure
=========

Some configurable parameters may be found in three files: ``config.js``,
``app/config-debug.js`` and ``app/config-prod.js``.
