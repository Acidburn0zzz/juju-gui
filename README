README
======

Welcome. Juju-GUI is a web-based GUI for `Juju <https://juju.ubuntu.com/>`_.
Juju lets you deploy connected services to the cloud in a convenient,
vendor-neutral, and powerful way. The GUI lets you visualize and manage
your work more intuitively from a web browser.

Juju-GUI releases and the current code are `on Launchpad
<https://launchpad.net/juju-gui>`_.

- a `demo of trunk <http://uistage.jujucharms.com:8080/>`_, which is reset
  every 15 minutes.

Deploy
======

Deploying the GUI is easiest with `its charm
<https://jujucharms.com/~juju-gui/precise/juju-gui>`_.  If you want to simply
use the GUI, please try it.

If you want to develop the GUI, or you have a deployment goal that the charm
does not and cannot support, you can try the Makefile commands.  The most
useful available commands are shown by the ``make help`` command.

You will typically want to run one of ``make prod``,  ``make debug`` or ``make
devel`` to deploy an environment. You might also run ``make test-debug`` and
``make test-prod`` to check that everything is ok, and ``make docs`` to
generate the available documentation for both project and code. See the
:ref:`HACKING <all-docs>` file for details.

Configure
=========

Some configurable parameters may be found in three files:

- ``config.js``
- ``app/config-debug.js``
- ``app/config-prod.js``

If you are using `the charm
<https://jujucharms.com/~juju-gui/precise/juju-gui>`_, the end-user
configuration is available from the charm configuration.
