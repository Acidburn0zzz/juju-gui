Juju-GUI
========

Welcome. Juju-GUI is a web-based GUI for `Juju <https://juju.ubuntu.com/>`_.
Juju lets you deploy connected services to the cloud in a convenient,
vendor-neutral, and powerful way. The GUI lets you visualize and manage
your work more intuitively from a web browser.

Deploy
======

There are no official releases of Juju-GUI yet, so you have to get the source
code from Launchpad::

  $ bzr branch lp:juju-gui

The most useful available commands are shown by the command::

  $ make help

You'll typically want to run one of ``make prod``,  ``make debug`` or ``make
devel`` to deploy an environment. You might also run ``make test`` to check
that everything is ok. You may also run ``make doc`` to generate the available
documentation.

Configure
=========
